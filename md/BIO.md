Architectural and Urban Design, Computation, Data, AI, Visualization Specialist, Director, and founder of NJSTUDIO and NJSLab.

NJ Namju Lee is an architectural and urban designer, researcher, and lecturer. He has been the principal of NJSTUDIO since 2004, specializing in architecture, computational design, and visualization. He graduated from Seoul National University of Science and Technology(B.S), later, UC Berkeley(MArch), and Harvard Graduate School of Design(MDes) with 3 Distinctions, 3 High Passes, and 1st Digital Design Prize.

He worked both at UrbanAid Lab at the University of Technology, Sydney(UTS), at SENSEable City Lab and Media Lab(Changing Places Group) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT), and at the College of Environmental Design, UC Berkeley. He was invited to workshops and seminars as a lecturer in several universities, including Harvard, MIT, Ministry of Labor Korea, and Autodesk Korea, and he taught Digital Design Studio I and II at Sejong University, Seoul, Korea. He published ‘Computational Design’ and ‘Simulation & Visualization of Architecture’. He contributed articles and chapters for the Architectural Institute of Korea, the Korean Institute of Building Information Modeling, the Korean Physical Society, and magazines. He has participated in multi-disciplinary exhibitions, digital film, and architectural group works in Seoul and Sydney. As a visualization specialist, His collaborators include KPF, HYUNDAI, SAMSUNG, SK, and posco E&C for architectural 3D animation and simulation projects. He worked as a software engineer, researcher, and developer at ESRI and is working at Ready.net.

He works in the integrative and interdisciplinary domain of built environment and design technology, with a particular interest in the data as design materials. Central to his practice is the use of data as the primary methodology in shaping a design process by integrated computation, artificial intelligence, and visualization.
